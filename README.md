Things I want to build/wish existed

- mitm online service
- ebook cloudstorage platform
- VR game with Hubble Deep space data.. basically be able to see space in 3d/move around in it?
- Wedding app that integrates with:
  - pinterest
  - tripadvisor (food/hotels/points of interest)
  - airbnb (hotels)
  - skype
  - whatsapp
  - google drive/map/calendar/contacts/mail/youtube videos
  - text messaging/phone
  - facebook
- calendar/map that integrates with tripit & google maps
  - list all the places I'm going next and pin them
  - integrate with tripadvisor so I can quickly search for things to do near each pin?
  - allow me to quickly add a tripadvisor pin to my tripit itinerary?
  - create a google custom map with support for layers (so we can add search results ontop for mobile)
  
  
# Calendar + Map
    Hey /r/travel,

    I travel fairly frequently (probably not as much as some of you though) and I've noticed that the sites I use for research/planning are just not working together the way I'd like. As a developer my first instinct was to build something, but I thought maybe you guys could help. 

    TripIt is my primary itinerary tracker, however it only helps me visualize & track items that I've actually purchased, it's not really designed to help you make decisions when you're still deciding between visiting one city or another. 

    Here's some of the apps that I use when planning:

    - Kayak/Hipmunk - Figure out flight costs
    - TripAdvisor - I use tripadvisor to research hotels, things to do, places to eat
    - AirBnb - I use AirBnB to create wishlist maps of cheap, clean & safe places to stay near the places I'm interested in
    - Rome2Rio - I use Rome2Rio to get rough time & cost estimates for travel between locations
    - Yelp/Foursquare - Plan things to do & places to eat
    - Wiki Travel/ subreddits - Misc research to fill in the gaps

    As I'm using these disparate sites to do research I often find myself wanting to compare results from one site to another. 
    eg. 

    - I want to map out all the TripIt items I've already purchased
    - overlay that with all the potential AirBnB's I've put on a wishlist
    - overlay that with the top ~30 TripAdvisor Hotels in a city within my price 
    - overlay that with the important things to do that I've found on TripAdvisor
    - then individually toggle layers on and off, and filter each layer individually
    - filter on layers/locations on date ranges
    - decide which hotel/airbnb to stay at (and for how long) by looking at the cluster of things to do nearby


    Since "export map" & "calendar view" isn't a feature on most of these sites, I find myself doing things like dumping the JSON response from an AirBnB wishlist and importing it into custom Google Maps, or (most often) just manually adding map markers manually. 

    Like I mentioned earlier, I'm a developer so my first instinct is to just build something that integrates with a Google Calendar, Google Maps, TripAdvisor, TripIt & AirBnB and lets me do map-based planning myself, but I'd rather not re-invent the wheel if something already exists.

    Thanks!
